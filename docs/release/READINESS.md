## Final Verification (Before v1.1.0 Release Tag)

Run this before tagging:

```bash
# Full validation suite
make gates

# Check documentation
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|XXX" docs/ examples/ || echo "✓ No blockers"

# Verify modules
go run ./internal/checks/module-manifests
go run ./internal/checks/dependency-rules
go run ./internal/checks/reference-layout
go run ./internal/checks/public-entrypoints-sync

# Build examples
go build ./examples/hello
go build ./examples/standard-api
go build ./examples/error-handling

# Verify links (manual spot-check)
echo "Check: README links to POSITIONING.md" && grep -q "POSITIONING.md" README.md && echo "✓"
echo "Check: STABILITY.md references 9 roots" && grep -c "^| \`" STABILITY.md | grep 9 && echo "✓"
echo "Check: extension-guide.md references all extensions" && grep -q "x/rest\|x/websocket" docs/start/extension-guide.md && echo "✓"
```

**Status for release:** ✅ ALL GREEN
