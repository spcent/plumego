## Purpose

`store` holds persistence primitives and base abstractions.

## v1 Status

- `ga` in the Plumego v1 support matrix
- v1 normalization removes compatibility aliases and no-error wrappers before
  the final stable surface is frozen

## Use this module when

- defining stable storage contracts
- implementing basic persistence helpers
- working below topology-heavy data features

## Do not use this module for

- tenant-aware storage policy
- tenant-aware adapters
- sharding or heavy topology defaults in stable roots
- app bootstrap

## First files to read

- `store/module.yaml`
- the target package under `store/*`
- `specs/repo.yaml`

## Canonical change shape

- keep interfaces narrow
- keep concurrent behavior testable
- move topology-heavy features to owning extensions
- keep cache and KV constructors explicit about validation errors; do not panic on invalid config
- `store/cache` reports empty or unsafe request keys with `cache.ErrInvalidKey`, while cache configuration errors remain classified under `cache.ErrInvalidConfig`.
- `store/cache` and `store/kv` treat `nil` values and non-nil empty byte slices as existing caller-owned values; missing keys remain distinguishable through not-found errors and existence checks.
- `store/cache.MemoryCache.Delete` is idempotent for missing keys and returns nil after validating the key and lifecycle state; `store/kv.KVStore.Delete` returns `kv.ErrKeyNotFound` when the key is missing.
- `store/cache.Incr` and `store/cache.Decr` create missing keys as integer values, but existing empty byte values are non-integers and return `cache.ErrNotInteger`.
- `store/cache.MemoryCache.Stats` returns a point-in-time snapshot of tracked entries, payload bytes, and closed lifecycle state; it does not mutate the cache or export provider-specific metrics.
- `store/cache.MemoryCache` expired-entry cleanup scans the whole in-process map on each cleanup pass instead of stopping at an arbitrary entry cap; this keeps cleanup predictable for stable in-process use.
- `store/cache.MemoryCache` and `store/kv.KVStore` are constructor-only objects; zero-value or nil receiver operations fail closed with the package closed-store sentinel where practical.
- `store/cache.MemoryCache.Close` closes the cache lifecycle; it waits for the cache write boundary before returning, and later operations return `cache.ErrCacheClosed`.
- keep DB analytics, summaries, instrumentation wrappers, pool-stat polling, and slow-query inspection out of `store/db`; route them to `x/observability/dbinsights`
- keep DB health payloads, open-retry loops, and generic timeout policy helpers out of `store/db`; callers own operation deadlines through `context.Context`
- keep HTTP response caching, request-derived cache keys, and cache metrics/introspection ownership out of `store/cache`
- keep signed URLs, metadata-manager ownership, uploader/image metadata, and file path/id helper policy out of `store/file`; route them to `x/data/file` and `x/fileapi`
- keep durable KV-engine concerns such as WAL, snapshots, serializer selection, compression, and shard tuning out of `store/kv`; route them to `x/data/kvengine`
- keep durable idempotency providers, SQL dialect policy, and table schema policy out of `store/idempotency`; route them to `x/data/idempotency`

## Behavior Matrix

| Package | Missing read | Expired read | Missing delete | Invalid key/path | Closed behavior | Nil context |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `store/cache` | `Get` returns `ErrNotFound`; `Exists` returns `false, nil` | `Get` returns `ErrNotFound`; `Exists` returns `false, nil` after best-effort cleanup | `Delete` returns nil | Empty or unsafe keys return `ErrInvalidKey`; some validation paths also wrap `ErrInvalidConfig` | Mutations and reads return `ErrCacheClosed` | Accepted as no cancellation signal |
| `store/kv` | `Get` returns `ErrKeyNotFound`; `ExistsContext` returns false | `Get` prunes and returns `ErrKeyExpired`; read-only context helpers ignore expired entries | `Delete` returns `ErrKeyNotFound` | Empty keys return `ErrInvalidKey`; invalid options return validation errors | Mutations, value reads, and read-only context helpers return `ErrStoreClosed` | Accepted as no cancellation signal |
| `store/file` | Concrete backends should report `ErrNotFound` or wrap it in `*file.Error` | Not modeled in the stable interface | Concrete backends should report `ErrNotFound` or wrap it in `*file.Error` | Invalid paths return `ErrInvalidPath` or wrap it in `*file.Error` | Backend-owned | Implementations receive and should honor the caller context |
| `store/idempotency` | `Get` returns `found=false, nil`; terminal operations return `ErrNotFound` | `Get` returns `found=false, nil`; `Complete` returns `ErrNotFound` after cleanup | `Delete` returns `ErrNotFound` | Empty keys return `ErrInvalidKey` | Backend-owned | Implementations receive and should honor the caller context |
| `store/db` | `ScanRow` maps `sql.ErrNoRows` to `ErrNoRows`; `QueryRowStrict` returns `ErrNoRows` | Not modeled | Not modeled | Invalid config returns `ErrInvalidConfig`; nil DB returns operation-specific sentinel wrappers | `*sql.DB` lifecycle is caller-owned | Passed through exactly to `database/sql` |

## File Boundary

- `store/file` is the stable contract layer for file storage interfaces, shared file types, and errors.
- `store/file` is contract-only and does not bundle a local filesystem, object storage, tenant-aware, or HTTP-facing backend implementation.
- `store/file` metadata clone helpers detach common nested mutable values such as `map[string]any`, `map[string]string`, `[]any`, `[]string`, and `[]byte`.
- `x/data/file` is the tenant-aware implementation layer for local/S3 storage backends, provider-specific config, metadata persistence, and thumbnail/image-processing helpers.
- `x/fileapi` is the HTTP transport layer for upload, download, info, delete, list, and temporary URL endpoints.
- Do not move tenant-aware path policy, metadata query parameter types, backend-specific behavior, or image-processing pipelines into stable `store/file`.
- Do not move HTTP handlers or multipart parsing into stable `store`.
- `store/file.Storage` defines transport-agnostic operations only; concrete backends must document list ordering, copy overwrite behavior, metadata preservation, and missing-delete behavior.
- `PutOptions.Metadata` and `File.Metadata` are caller-owned unless a backend explicitly documents defensive-copy behavior.
- Stable file backends should expose missing-path and invalid-path failures through `ErrNotFound` and `ErrInvalidPath`, either directly or through `*file.Error`.
- Tenant-aware local file backends must validate generated upload path components and verify final filesystem paths stay inside the configured storage root.
- Local file backends must bound per-upload disk writes; `x/data/file.LocalConfig.MaxUploadSize` defaults to 32 MiB and oversized uploads expose `ErrInvalidSize`.
- S3-compatible file backends must bound per-upload buffering; `x/data/file.S3Config.MaxUploadSize` defaults to 32 MiB and oversized uploads expose `ErrInvalidSize`.

## KV Boundary

- `store/kv` is the stable small embedded KV primitive for file-backed key/value persistence, TTL-aware CRUD, key scans, and basic stats.
- `store/kv.NewKVStore` requires an explicit `Options.DataDir`; it does not create a relative default data directory for `Options{}`.
- `store/kv` exposes context-aware inspection operations for callers that need
  cancellation or error visibility. `Set`, `Get`, and `Delete` remain
  synchronous convenience methods; `Exists`, `Keys`, `Size`, and `GetStats`
  were removed in favor of their context-aware forms.
- `store/kv` context-aware operations check cancellation before lock acquisition and again after lock acquisition; once full-state filesystem persistence begins, that filesystem phase is not interruptible.
- `store/kv` persists the full in-memory state as JSON on each write, fsyncs the temporary state file, atomically replaces the state file, and syncs the parent directory when the platform supports it; it is intended for small embedded datasets rather than high-throughput durable-engine workloads.
- `store/kv` does not rewrite the state file during startup normalization; expired or over-capacity records can be pruned from memory without mutating disk until the next caller-initiated write.
- `store/kv` read operations do not persist expired-key cleanup as a side effect.
- `store/kv` classifies state-file JSON decode failures and invalid persisted keys with `kv.ErrCorruptState`; invalid-key corruption also keeps `kv.ErrInvalidKey` in the error chain for diagnostics.
- `store/kv` treats invalid persisted keys as state corruption and fails startup instead of silently dropping records.
- `x/data/kvengine` owns durable-engine behavior such as WAL, snapshots, serializer formats, compression, and shard/flush tuning.
- Do not add engine-format plumbing, snapshot APIs, or durability-tuning knobs back into stable `store/kv`.
- `store/kv` write persistence is synchronous; use caller contexts on
  `SetContext`, `DeleteContext`, and read-only context helpers when
  cancellation must be observed before the filesystem write boundary.
- `store/kv` uses package name `kv`; examples may alias the import as `kvstore` only to avoid local name collisions.
- `store/kv.DefaultOptions(dataDir)` is the public helper for the current
  embedded defaults while keeping `DataDir` explicit; callers can start from it
  and then override limits as needed.
- `NewKVStore` requires an explicit `Options.DataDir` and returns a validation
  error for invalid options; it must not silently write to the process working
  directory.
- Default capacity for the embedded state file helper is 100000 entries and
  200 MiB. Callers needing different bounds should pass explicit limits after
  measuring, and callers needing durable-engine tuning should use
  `x/data/kvengine`.
- `store/kv` uses a single JSON state file replaced with `os.Rename`; each mutation rewrites the full normalized state and is O(N) in the number of retained entries.
- Invalid keys in the persisted state file fail load with an `ErrInvalidKey`-wrapped error instead of being silently dropped.
- `store/kv` does not provide cross-process locking, WAL, snapshots, directory fsync, or crash-recovery tuning.
- A non-positive TTL means no expiration. `Get` prunes expired keys and returns
  `ErrKeyExpired`; read-only helpers such as `ExistsContext`, `KeysContext`,
  `SizeContext`, and `GetStatsContext` ignore expired keys without mutating
  persisted state.
- `Delete` returns `ErrKeyNotFound` for missing keys. `Close` is idempotent;
  after close, value reads, mutations, and read-only inspection return
  `ErrStoreClosed`.

## Idempotency Boundary

- `store/idempotency` is the stable primitive contract for idempotency records, statuses, errors, and the minimal `Store` interface.
- `store/idempotency.HashAwareStore` is the optional completion extension for providers that validate `RequestHash` during completion without changing the base `Store` interface.
- `store/idempotency.ValidateCompletion` fixes stable completion classification: mismatched request hashes return `ErrRequestMismatch`, same-hash completed records return `ErrAlreadyCompleted`, and expired records return `ErrExpired` before duplicate-completion replay decisions.
- `x/data/idempotency` owns durable KV/SQL provider implementations, SQL dialect policy, table naming, and duplicate-key handling.
- Do not add provider-specific adapters, table schema policy, or feature-specific dedupe rules back into stable `store/idempotency`.
- `store/idempotency` persists `RequestHash` but does not decide hash-conflict or replay policy; callers compare hashes after `Get` when the business operation requires it.
- `PutIfAbsent` reports whether the current call claimed the key; `false, nil` means a usable record or backend duplicate prevented the claim, not that the request is safe to replay without inspecting the record.
- Terminal cleanup operations are deterministic: missing or expired `Complete` returns `ErrNotFound`, and missing `Delete` returns `ErrNotFound`.
- SQL-backed idempotency providers must validate table identifiers and dialect values before query construction; table names are provider configuration, not caller input.

## DB Boundary

- `store/db` helpers execute with the exact `context.Context` supplied by the caller.
- `store/db.Open` initializes a `*sql.DB` handle and does not prove connectivity; use `Ping` when startup validation is required.
- `store/db.QueryRow` mirrors `database/sql.QueryRowContext` and defers query or scan errors until the returned row is scanned.
- `store/db.QueryRowContext` returns an explicit `ErrQueryFailed`-wrapped error for nil database inputs instead of returning a nil row.
- Query and transaction helpers must not infer deadlines from optional config interfaces.
- Use `context.WithTimeout` or `context.WithDeadline` at the application or owning extension boundary when an operation deadline is required.
- tenant configuration schema and migrations belong in `x/tenant/config`, not stable `store/db`

## Extension-layer cache implementations

Topology-heavy and provider-specific cache implementations have been migrated out of the stable root and now live in `x/data/cache`:

- `x/data/cache/distributed` — consistent-hashing distributed cache with replication and failover
- `x/data/cache/leaderboard` — ranked-data cache built on top of stable `store/cache` primitives
- `x/data/cache/redis` — Redis client adapter implementing `store/cache.Cache`

Current rule:

- do not add new topology-heavy or provider-heavy siblings under stable `store/cache`
- in-process cache cleanup scans all entries on each cleanup tick so expired entries do not remain solely because of a fixed scan cap
- do not add HTTP response caching middleware or request-derived cache helpers under stable `store/cache`
- do not add tenant-aware adapters or tenant-specific storage policy under stable `store`
- route new topology-heavy cache capabilities to `x/data/cache`
- route HTTP response caching to `x/gateway/cache`
- route tenant-aware cache adapters to `x/tenant/store/cache`

## v1 Breaking Normalization

- `store/cache.ErrNotFound` is the only cache-miss sentinel;
  `ErrCacheMiss` has been removed.
- `store/kv.Exists`, `Keys`, `Size`, and `GetStats` have been removed because
  they collapsed invalid key, closed-store, and cancellation errors. Use
  `ExistsContext`, `KeysContext`, `SizeContext`, and `GetStatsContext`.
