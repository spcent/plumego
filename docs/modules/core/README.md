# core

## Purpose

`core` is the HTTP application kernel. It owns app construction, route attachment, middleware attachment, and server lifecycle.

## v1 Status

- `ga` in the Plumego v1 support matrix
- Public compatibility is expected for the stable package surface

## Use this module when

- assembling an application from explicit routes and middleware
- starting or stopping an HTTP server
- wiring passive runtime dependencies such as logging, and attaching metrics
  through middleware or app-local wiring

## Do not use this module for

- route matching
- feature catalogs or plugin containers
- tenant policy
- persistence behavior

## Configuration contract

`DefaultConfig()` is the supported baseline for application code. Custom
`AppConfig` values are copied by value during `New`, so later mutations to the
caller-owned config value do not affect the app.

Server hardening fields follow standard `http.Server` zero-value semantics:
zero timeouts disable that specific timeout and `MaxHeaderBytes == 0` leaves the
server on the standard library default. `Prepare` rejects empty addresses and
negative timeout/header-size values before freezing route or middleware
mutation. `DrainInterval <= 0` uses core's default drain logging interval.

`HTTP2Enabled` controls the prepared server's TLS HTTP/2 policy. When false,
core installs an empty `TLSNextProto` map on the returned `*http.Server`, which
matches the standard-library mechanism for disabling automatic TLS HTTP/2
configuration. It is not an h2c or universal protocol-negotiation switch.

TLS ownership is intentionally narrow. The stable core TLS API is basic
certificate/key loading through `TLSConfig.Enabled`, `TLSConfig.CertFile`, and
`TLSConfig.KeyFile`. `Prepare` loads that material into the prepared
`*http.Server`; callers own advanced TLS policy such as minimum versions, cipher
suites, client certificates, and custom `GetCertificate` behavior by adjusting
`Server().TLSConfig` before serving. Core intentionally does not expose
additional TLS policy hooks in `AppConfig`.

`Server()` returns the prepared `*http.Server` to preserve standard-library
compatibility. Direct caller overrides are caller-owned: replacing `Handler`
bypasses the prepared core handler and middleware chain, replacing `ConnState`
bypasses core open-connection tracking, replacing `TLSConfig` replaces the
loaded TLS material, and replacing `TLSNextProto` changes the prepared HTTP/2
policy.

Logger ownership is passive. `core.New` resolves a missing
`AppDependencies.Logger` to a discard logger, and `(*App).Logger()` also returns
a discard logger when the app logger field is missing. App methods require a
non-nil `*App`; calling methods on a nil receiver is treated as a programmer
error rather than a recoverable lifecycle state. Core does not keep a package-level
fallback logger singleton and does not start, stop, flush, or close logger
implementations for the caller.

## Error contract

Core lifecycle and wiring entrypoints return normal Go errors. Errors include
stable `core <operation>` diagnostic context, may include operation parameters
before the final cause, include stable operation names such as `prepare_server`,
`get_server`, `shutdown_app`, `add_route`, and `use_middleware`, and wrap
lower-level causes where a caller-owned dependency or the standard library
produced the failure.

The stable core surface intentionally does not export lifecycle sentinel errors.
Callers should handle errors at the operation boundary, use `errors.Is` only for
wrapped lower-level causes that are already exported by the producing package,
and avoid depending on ad hoc string parsing for branching behavior. Operation
names are stable diagnostic context, not a typed lifecycle error taxonomy.

## Main risks when changing this module

- startup regression
- shutdown regression
- route assembly regression

## Canonical change shape

- keep bootstrap explicit
- construct apps through `DefaultConfig()` / `AppConfig`, and use `AppDependencies` as the explicit constructor dependency contract
- treat `DefaultConfig()` as the supported baseline: `Prepare` rejects empty server addresses and negative server hardening values before freezing route/middleware mutation; zero timeout fields keep standard `http.Server` semantics
- keep lifecycle behavior reviewable
- keep one canonical lifecycle path: `Prepare` + `Server` + `Shutdown`
- split handler preparation from server preparation: `ServeHTTP` only freezes config/router state and builds the handler, while `Prepare` is the explicit path that validates server-only config, allocates `http.Server`, and prepares connection tracking
- keep server-only preparation validation non-destructive: TLS config and certificate load failures return before route/middleware mutation is frozen
- keep TLS on the same public serve path: `Prepare` loads configured certificates into the returned `*http.Server`, and callers use `ListenAndServeTLS("", "")` on that prepared server when TLS is enabled
- keep `core` as the first-party router owner: route wiring goes through
  `App.AddRoute` or the registered method helpers; `App.AddRoute` is the
  canonical path when route options such as `router.WithRouteName(...)` are
  needed, and reverse URL lookup goes through `App.URL(...)`, not raw router
  replacement or mutation
- do not add more route convenience wrappers; new protocol or feature-specific
  route factories belong in application wiring or the owning extension
- keep HTTP request metrics explicit in middleware/app-local wiring; `core` does not own live observer attachment state
- keep readiness ownership out of `core`; callers own the outer serve loop, so readiness signaling must stay app-local instead of pretending the kernel knows when traffic can flow
- keep logger subsystem ownership out of `core`; `core.AppDependencies{Logger: ...}` injects a passive dependency and callers own logger initialization and flushing
- keep app-local debug flags and env-file metadata outside `core`; the kernel owns HTTP runtime state, not devtools metadata transport
- keep debug/runtime snapshot payloads in `x/observability/devtools`; `core` owns lifecycle state, not tooling response contracts
- keep the app logger kernel-owned on `App.Logger()`; `router` stays logger-free and does not mirror app logger state
- keep router behavior policy in typed config, not in ad hoc constructor options
- push feature-specific wiring back to app-local code or the owning extension
- preserve `net/http` compatibility while keeping `core` as a kernel

## Frozen behavior matrix

These behaviors are part of the current stable-root freeze baseline:

| Surface | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Construction | `New` copies `AppConfig` by value and resolves missing dependencies to safe defaults |
| Preparation state | `PreparationState` names the stable mutation, handler-prepared, and server-prepared phases exposed by core; `(*App).PreparationState()` returns the current phase as a read-only snapshot and returns the empty value for zero-value apps |
| Config validation | `Prepare` rejects invalid server config before freezing route/middleware mutation |
| Route wiring | `AddRoute` and method helpers delegate to the owned router with explicit method/path handlers |
| Middleware wiring | `Use` preserves registration order, treats an empty middleware list as a no-op, and rejects nil middleware without partial registration |
| `ServeHTTP` | lazily prepares the handler only, skips server-only config validation, freezes later route/middleware mutation, and remains `net/http` compatible |
| `ServeHTTP` then failed `Prepare` | if direct handler use already put the app in `handler_prepared`, a later server-only config failure from `Prepare` keeps the app handler-prepared, leaves `Server()` unavailable, and does not reopen route or middleware mutation |
| `Prepare` | freezes handler state, builds one `http.Server`, prepares open HTTP connection tracking, applies the configured TLS HTTP/2 policy, and is idempotent |
| `Prepare` failure | while the app is still mutable, server-only config errors return before freezing route/middleware mutation |
| `Server` | returns an error before explicit server preparation and returns the prepared server after `Prepare` |
| `Shutdown` | requires a prepared server, tolerates nil contexts by using `context.Background()`, delegates shutdown to `http.Server`, starts one open-connection drain attempt at a time, and permits retry after context cancellation while connections remain open |
| Post-shutdown | after successful shutdown, the app remains `server_prepared`, `Server()` and `Prepare()` keep returning the same closed `*http.Server`, repeated `Shutdown` is accepted, and `ServeHTTP` can still serve through the prepared handler; caller code must create a new app to prepare a fresh server |
| TLS | `Prepare` loads configured cert/key material into the returned `*http.Server` |
| Ownership | logger lifecycle, readiness signaling, debug routes, and feature wiring remain caller-owned |

Focused regression coverage lives in `core/freeze_test.go`,
`core/lifecycle_test.go`, `core/app_test.go`, and `core/routing_test.go`.
