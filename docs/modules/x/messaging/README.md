# x/messaging

## Purpose

`x/messaging` is the canonical app-facing entrypoint for the messaging family.

## v1 Status

- `beta` in the Plumego v1.1 support matrix for the app-facing service surface
- Included in repository release scope with beta compatibility obligations for
  the documented app-facing `x/messaging` public surface
- Subordinate primitives (`mq`, `pubsub`, `scheduler`, `webhook`) remain
  experimental until their own evidence is recorded.

## Use this module when

- the task is message send orchestration
- the task is app-facing queue, pubsub, scheduler, or webhook wiring
- the task needs a family-level messaging entrypoint instead of a lower-level primitive

## Do not use this module for

- application bootstrap
- stable-root abstractions
- direct low-level primitive work when the task is clearly only `x/messaging/mq` or `x/messaging/pubsub`

## First files to read

- `x/messaging/module.yaml`
- `x/messaging/entrypoints.go`
- `specs/extension-taxonomy.yaml`

## Main risks when changing this module

- message flow regression
- provider global state leakage
- family entrypoint ambiguity returning across sibling packages

## Boundary rules

- `x/messaging` is the app-facing family entrypoint; internal messaging primitives (`x/messaging/mq`, `x/messaging/pubsub`, `x/messaging/scheduler`, `x/messaging/webhook`) must not bypass it for cross-family wiring
- keep send orchestration explicit in `x/messaging`; do not add implicit retry, deduplication, or routing policies at import time
- do not expose transport-layer internals (broker connection strings, topic naming conventions) through `x/messaging` API; keep those local to the owning subordinate package
- keep `x/messaging` transport-agnostic at the family boundary; owning handlers choose the subordinate primitive
- keep queue and worker runtime assembly in `runtime.go`; `Service.New` should consume that runtime and remain focused on messaging orchestration, provider handlers, receipts, metrics, monitoring, and webhook notification wiring

## Canonical change shape

- start app-facing messaging work here
- keep orchestration explicit
- keep `x/messaging/mq`, `x/messaging/pubsub`, `x/messaging/scheduler`, and `x/messaging/webhook` subordinate to this family
- app-facing and admin HTTP success responses use `contract.WriteResponse`; direct JSON writes are reserved for non-JSON streaming surfaces outside this family
- app-facing HTTP success payloads should use local typed DTOs instead of one-off maps
- HTTP error responses expose stable contract codes and user-safe messages; provider, broker, scheduler, and store errors must not be written with raw `err.Error()` text
- SMS metrics exporters should use `NewSMSPrometheusExporterE` when nil metric source wiring must be handled as an error; `NewSMSPrometheusExporter` preserves legacy panic behavior

## Subordinate packages

Open sibling packages only when the task is already known to be narrow:

- `x/messaging/mq`: durable queue primitives and worker coordination
- `x/messaging/pubsub`: in-process broker primitives
- `x/messaging/scheduler`: cron, delayed job, and retry coordination
- `x/messaging/webhook`: inbound verification or outbound delivery mechanics

Subordinate packages are not app-facing discovery roots. Open them directly
only after the owning task is already narrowed to that primitive.

### `x/messaging/mq`

Use `x/messaging/mq` for queue persistence, task workers, dead-letter handling,
and queue-task dedupe adapters. Start with `x/messaging/mq/module.yaml`.

Public entrypoints include `NewTaskQueue`, `NewWorker`, `NewInProcBrokerE`,
`store.NewMemory`, `store.NewSQL`, and `NewKVPersistence`.

MQTT and AMQP server bridges are not implemented. `Config.Validate` fails
closed when `EnableMQTT` or `EnableAMQP` is true, wrapping
`ErrNotImplemented`. `StartMQTTServer` and `StartAMQPServer` remain
compatibility stubs only.

`EnableMQTT`, `MQTTPort`, `EnableAMQP`, and `AMQPPort` are deprecated
compatibility placeholders. They do not enable a partial bridge mode, and the
port fields have no effect while protocol support is unavailable. Leave them
disabled for v1 and prefer direct `x/messaging/pubsub` integration unless a
future card lands a real bridge implementation.

Validate narrow queue work with:

- `go test -race -timeout 60s ./x/messaging/mq/...`
- `go test -timeout 20s ./x/messaging/mq/...`
- `go vet ./x/messaging/mq/...`

### `x/messaging/pubsub`

Use `x/messaging/pubsub` for broker semantics, topic fan-out, replay,
backpressure, distributed pubsub helpers, and debug-friendly in-process broker
support. Start with `x/messaging/pubsub/module.yaml`.

Public entrypoints include `New`, `NewPersistent`, `NewDistributed`,
`NewReplayStore`, `NewBackpressureController`, and `NewPrometheusExporter`.

Exact-topic subscriptions use `Subscribe(ctx, topic, opts)`. Context
cancellation is part of the canonical API, not a compatibility wrapper.

Distributed cluster HTTP endpoints fail closed by default when `AuthToken` is
empty. Set `AllowInsecureAuth` only for local tests or explicitly isolated
development clusters. Malformed cluster JSON requests use
`contract.CodeInvalidJSON`, while success responses use typed DTOs through
`contract.WriteResponse`.

Wrappers that own background goroutines must keep lifecycle state
instance-local, stop workers through `Close`, and make repeated `Close` calls
safe.

Validate narrow pubsub work with:

- `go test -race -timeout 60s ./x/messaging/pubsub/...`
- `go test -timeout 20s ./x/messaging/pubsub/...`
- `go vet ./x/messaging/pubsub/...`

### `x/messaging/scheduler`

Use `x/messaging/scheduler` for scheduler primitives, delayed job execution,
retry coordination, and cron helpers. Start with
`x/messaging/scheduler/module.yaml`.

Public entrypoints include `New`, `NewAdminHandler`, `NewMemoryStore`,
`NewKVStore`, `RetryFixed`, and `RetryExponential`.

Admin HTTP query filters fail closed for malformed boolean values. Invalid
`running`, `paused`, or `asc` values return a structured validation error
instead of silently changing filter behavior.

Validate narrow scheduler work with:

- `go test -race -timeout 60s ./x/messaging/scheduler/...`
- `go test -timeout 20s ./x/messaging/scheduler/...`
- `go vet ./x/messaging/scheduler/...`

### `x/messaging/webhook`

Use `x/messaging/webhook` for narrow webhook verification, provider-specific
inbound handlers, outbound delivery, and pubsub-to-webhook bridge wiring. Start
with `x/messaging/webhook/module.yaml`.

Public entrypoints include `NewService`, `NewInbound`, `NewOutbound`,
`NewMemStore`, `VerifyHMAC`, `VerifyGitHub`, and `VerifyStripe`.

Webhook verification must fail closed. Secrets, tokens, signatures, and HMAC
keys must not be logged or returned in error messages. Delivery retry state must
remain instance-scoped.

Use `ConfigFromReaderE` when constructing outbound config from a reader that
may be nil; `ConfigFromReader` is retained as the panic-compatible wrapper.
Outbound `enabled` query filters accept only `true`, `false`, `1`, or `0`; other
values fail with a structured validation error.

Validate narrow webhook work with:

- `go test -race -timeout 60s ./x/messaging/webhook/...`
- `go test -timeout 20s ./x/messaging/webhook/...`
- `go vet ./x/messaging/webhook/...`

## Validation commands

- `go test -race -timeout 60s ./x/messaging/...`
- `go test -timeout 20s ./x/messaging/...`
- `go vet ./x/messaging/...`
