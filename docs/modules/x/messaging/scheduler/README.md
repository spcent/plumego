# x/messaging/scheduler — Task Scheduling

> **Import path:** `github.com/spcent/plumego/x/messaging/scheduler` — sub-package of [`x/messaging`](../README.md). This primer mirrors the package path under `docs/modules/x/`.

**Purpose:** In-process scheduling primitives within the `x/messaging` family. Provides cron parsing, delayed job execution, retry policies (fixed and exponential), in-memory and KV-backed job stores, and an admin HTTP handler.

**Status:** Experimental — API may change. Start app-facing messaging feature discovery from [`x/messaging`](../README.md) before opening this package directly.

## First files to read

- `x/messaging/scheduler/module.yaml`
- `x/messaging/scheduler/scheduler.go` — `Scheduler`, `New`
- `x/messaging/scheduler/cron.go` — `ParseCronSpec`, `ParseCronSpecWithLocation`
- `x/messaging/module.yaml`

## Key types

| Type / Constructor | Description |
|---|---|
| `Scheduler` / `New` | Core scheduler managing job lifecycle and dispatch |
| `MemoryStore` / `NewMemoryStore` | In-memory job store for local dev and tests |
| `KVStore` / `NewKVStore` | Persistent KV-backed job store |
| `AdminHandler` / `NewAdminHandler` | HTTP handler for scheduler management endpoints |
| `RetryFixed` | Fixed-interval retry policy |
| `RetryExponential` | Exponential backoff retry policy |
| `ParseCronSpec` | Parse a 5-field cron expression |
| `JobID` | Job identity type |
| `TaskFunc` | `func(ctx) error` job handler contract |

---

## Boundary rules

- Keep scheduling behavior stateless between job runs; job state lives in the store.
- Do not use `x/messaging/scheduler` as a competing family entry point; start new messaging work from `x/messaging`.
- Keep retry policy caller-owned; do not hard-code retry behavior in the scheduler.
- The `AdminHandler` mounts protected endpoints; the caller must add appropriate auth middleware.

## Validation

```bash
go test -race -timeout 60s ./x/messaging/scheduler/...
go vet ./x/messaging/scheduler/...
```
