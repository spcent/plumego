# x/data

## Purpose

`x/data` contains topology-heavy and fast-evolving data capabilities such as sharding and advanced rw patterns.

## v1 Status

- `Experimental` in the Plumego v1 support matrix
- Included in repository release scope, but compatibility is not frozen
- Stable readiness review on 2026-05-04: core correctness blockers from the
  follow-up cards are addressed, but the module remains experimental until the
  public API surface, SQL support policy, and operational limits are frozen.

Stable promotion blockers:

- Keep SQL rewrite and routing support intentionally narrow unless a
  parser-backed strategy is approved; current support is a documented
  single-statement, single-table subset with fail-closed rejection for complex
  shapes.
- Define large-object S3 policy beyond standard-library single PUT spooling
  before advertising high-volume object storage guarantees.
- Run repo-wide gates before any status change from experimental to stable.

Frozen API decisions:

- `ClusterDB`/`New` is retained as a documented public convenience layer over
  `Router`; it takes ownership of configured shard DB handles.
- `kvengine.Options.AutoDetectMode` is the single format detection knob; do not
  reintroduce boolean double-switches before compatibility is frozen.

Second stable-readiness gate on 2026-05-05 passed:

- `go test -timeout 20s ./x/data/...`
- `go test -race -timeout 60s ./x/data/...`
- `go vet ./x/data/...`
- `go run ./internal/checks/dependency-rules`
- `go run ./internal/checks/agent-workflow`
- `go run ./internal/checks/module-manifests`
- `go run ./internal/checks/reference-layout`

Status remains `Experimental`: the second gate confirms the 0744-0750
correctness and lifecycle fixes, but public API freeze decisions and
large-object operational policy are still unresolved.

Third stable-readiness gate on 2026-05-05 passed after cards 0752-0760:

- `go test -timeout 20s ./x/data/...`
- `go test -race -timeout 60s ./x/data/...`
- `go vet ./x/data/...`
- `go run ./internal/checks/dependency-rules`
- `go run ./internal/checks/agent-workflow`
- `go run ./internal/checks/module-manifests`
- `go run ./internal/checks/reference-layout`

Status remains `Experimental`: tenant-scoped metadata, WAL sync semantics,
S3/local file hardening, config validation, SQL fail-closed boundaries, rw
balancer behavior, idempotency scope, and observability redaction have been
addressed. Promotion still needs API surface freeze decisions, explicit
large-object S3 policy, and repo-wide gates. Card 0762 replaced the ambiguous
legacy auto-detect boolean pair with one `AutoDetectMode` option.

Fourth stable-readiness gate on 2026-05-05 passed after cards 0762-0771:

- `go test -timeout 20s ./x/data/...`
- `go test -race -timeout 60s ./x/data/...`
- `go vet ./x/data/...`
- `go run ./internal/checks/dependency-rules`
- `go run ./internal/checks/agent-workflow`
- `go run ./internal/checks/module-manifests`
- `go run ./internal/checks/reference-layout`

Status remains `Experimental`: the fourth gate confirms the auto-detect API
freeze, compressed snapshot fail-closed behavior, sharding default safety,
tenant metadata listing, local/S3 file boundary hardening, rw lock-routing
precision, kvengine explicit default path, and sharding config docs/manifest
sync. Promotion still needs the SQL support policy decision, explicit
large-object S3 policy, and repo-wide gates.

## Submodules

### x/data/file — Tenant-Aware File Storage and Metadata

**Purpose:** Owns tenant-aware local/S3 storage implementations and PostgreSQL
file metadata persistence behind the stable `store/file` contracts.

**When to use:**
- You need tenant-isolated file paths, metadata records, or temporary URL
  generation.
- You need to change database metadata persistence for files.
- The task is storage behavior rather than HTTP multipart parsing or response
  headers.

**Key types:**

| Type / Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `LocalStorage` | Tenant-aware filesystem storage implementation |
| `S3Storage` | S3-compatible storage implementation |
| `DBMetadataManager` | PostgreSQL-backed metadata manager |
| `NewDBMetadataManagerE` | Error-returning metadata manager constructor for dynamic wiring |
| `WithMetadataClock` | Testable clock option for metadata mutation timestamps |

**Boundary rule:**
- Keep HTTP upload/download behavior in `x/fileapi`.
- Keep stable storage contracts and shared errors in `store/file`.
- Keep file metadata SQL behavior here; the DB metadata manager is PostgreSQL-only
  unless a future card adds explicit dialect support.
- Deduplication is tenant-scoped: same-content files in different tenants must
  not return another tenant's metadata record.
- Tenant-facing metadata reads and mutations are tenant-scoped by tenant id;
  global id/path metadata access is not part of the tenant storage contract.
- Tenant-facing metadata `List` requires `Query.TenantID`. Use
  `DBMetadataManager.ListAll` only for explicit admin/global metadata listings.
- Local and S3 storage generate object IDs from crypto-random bytes and fail the
  write if secure ID generation fails. S3 URLs preserve object-key hierarchy and
  escape unsafe path segments.
- S3 public path operations reject unsafe path-like keys before signing or
  sending requests; `List` permits an empty prefix for bucket-wide scans and
  validates non-empty prefixes. If object upload succeeds but metadata
  persistence fails, cleanup delete errors are joined into the returned error so
  orphan-object risk is visible to callers.
- Local writes go through a temporary file and check sync/close before rename.
- Local writes sync the containing directory after rename so directory metadata
  durability is requested where the platform supports it.
- Local list returns an empty result for missing prefixes and aborts promptly
  with the context error when the caller cancels traversal.
- Local static URLs validate storage paths and escape path segments. Local copy
  and thumbnail writes use the same temp-file, sync, close, rename, and
  directory-sync durability path as uploads. If local metadata persistence
  fails after storing a file or thumbnail, cleanup is attempted and cleanup
  errors are joined into the returned error.
- S3 `Put` hashes while spooling upload content to a temporary file, then
  streams that file to the object store with a fixed content length instead of
  buffering the whole object in memory. Set `S3Config.TempDir` to control the
  spool directory; S3 error response bodies are read with a small fixed bound
  before being included in returned errors. Presigned URLs include the actual
  request host in the SigV4 canonical request, and S3 status errors are returned
  explicitly instead of being treated as missing objects.

**See:** `x/data/file/module.yaml` for the manifest.

### x/data/idempotency — Durable Idempotency Providers

**Purpose:** Owns durable provider implementations for the stable `store/idempotency` contract.

**When to use:**
- You need a SQL-backed idempotency store with explicit dialect and table policy.
- You need a KV-backed idempotency store using the stable `store/kv` primitive.
- You are wiring extension features such as MQ task dedupe to durable idempotency persistence.

**Key types:**

| Type / Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `SQLStore` | SQL-backed implementation of `store/idempotency.Store` |
| `SQLConfig` | SQL dialect, table, and clock configuration |
| `KVStore` | KV-backed implementation of `store/idempotency.Store` |
| `KVConfig` | KV prefix and clock configuration |

**Boundary rule:**
- Keep `store/idempotency` limited to records, statuses, errors, and the minimal store contract.
- Keep SQL dialects, table policy, durable provider behavior, and duplicate-key handling in `x/data/idempotency`.
- Keep domain-specific dedupe rules in the owning application or extension, such as `x/mq`.
- `SQLConfig.DuplicateError` is the explicit duplicate-key classifier hook for
  driver-specific error codes. The built-in string matcher remains only as
  compatibility fallback behavior for existing tests and simple drivers.
- `Complete` is a conditional transition: only an existing, unexpired
  `in_progress` record can become `completed`. Missing, expired, or already
  final records return the existing not-found/expired sentinel behavior instead
  of being overwritten.
- KV-backed idempotency serializes claim/complete/delete sequences across
  wrappers that share the same in-process stable `store/kv` instance. It is
  local-process atomicity, not distributed CAS; use the SQL provider for
  multi-process durable idempotency coordination.

**See:** `x/data/idempotency/module.yaml` for the manifest.

### x/data/kvengine — Durable Embedded KV Engine

**Purpose:** Owns the topology-heavy and durability-heavy embedded KV engine surface that should not remain in stable `store/kv`.

**When to use:**
- You need WAL-backed persistence with explicit flush and cleanup intervals.
- You need snapshot/replay, serializer selection, compression, or shard-count tuning.
- The stable `store/kv` primitive is too small for the persistence behavior you need.

**Key types:**

| Type / Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `KVStore` | Durable embedded KV engine with WAL + snapshot support |
| `Options` | Engine config including flush cadence, cleanup cadence, compression, serializer format, auto-detect policy, shard count, and read-only mode |
| `SerializationFormat` | Binary/JSON engine format selection |
| `NewKVStore(opts)` | Constructor for the durable engine |
| `Default(dataDir)` | Convenience constructor with default engine tuning and an explicit data directory |

**Boundary rule:**
- Keep the stable `store/kv` package limited to the small embedded primitive.
- Route WAL, snapshots, serializer plumbing, compression, and shard tuning to `x/data/kvengine`.
- `NewKVStore` and `Default(dataDir)` require an explicit data directory; neither
  constructor silently creates a relative `data` directory.
- WAL replay fails closed on decode or CRC corruption. `WALSyncMode` defaults
  to `immediate`, so acknowledged Set/Delete calls flush and fsync the WAL
  before memory state changes; set `WALSyncInterval` only when async durability
  is an explicit performance tradeoff. `AutoDetectMode` defaults to
  `AutoDetectEnabled`; set `AutoDetectDisabled` when the configured serializer
  must be enforced.
- When `EnableCompression` is true, snapshot loading requires valid gzip data
  and fails closed instead of falling back to an uncompressed read.
- `SetMetricsCollector` observes `Set`, `Get`, and `Delete` operations,
  including misses and returned errors. Collector get/set/use is safe under
  concurrent access.
- `Close` is idempotent and repeated calls return the first close result.

**See:** `x/data/kvengine/module.yaml` for the manifest.

### x/data/rw — Read-Write Cluster

**Purpose:** Manages a primary-replica database cluster. Routes read queries to healthy replicas and write queries (and all transaction queries) to the primary.

**When to use:**
- Your service has one primary and one or more read replicas.
- You want automatic replica health checking and failover.
- You need per-query routing hints (`WithForcePrimary`, `WithPreferReplica`).

**Key types:**

| Type / Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `Cluster` | Manages a primary + replica set; implements `ExecContext`, `QueryContext`, `QueryRowContext`, `BeginTx` |
| `New(Config)` | Constructor; returns `(*Cluster, error)` |
| `Config` | Primary `*sql.DB`, `Replicas []*sql.DB`, load balancer, routing policy, health-check config |
| `LoadBalancer` | Interface; `NewRoundRobinBalancer()` and `NewWeightedBalancer(weights)` are built-in |
| `RoutingPolicy` | Interface; `NewSQLTypePolicy()`, `NewTransactionAwarePolicy()`, `NewAlwaysPrimaryPolicy()` |
| `WithForcePrimary(ctx)` | Returns a context that forces the next query to primary |
| `WithPreferReplica(ctx)` | Returns a context that prefers a replica for statements classified as safe reads |

**Routing rules:**
- `ExecContext` → always primary.
- `BeginTx` → always primary; marks the context so subsequent queries in that transaction also use primary.
- `QueryContext` / `QueryRowContext` → primary if `SQLTypePolicy` detects a write keyword, lock-taking read, or unknown statement; replica for known-safe reads.
- Lock-taking read detection ignores SQL string literals and comments so
  literal labels such as `'FOR UPDATE'` do not force primary routing.
- `WithForcePrimary(ctx)` is the explicit escape hatch for read-after-write or any other "read from primary now" requirement.
- `WithPreferReplica(ctx)` only affects known-safe reads; it cannot force write-like or unknown statements to replicas.
- If all replicas are unhealthy and `FallbackToPrimary` is explicitly set to `true`, reads fall back to primary; otherwise the query returns a routing error.
- Background replica health checks run only when `HealthCheck.Enabled` is `true`; they use periodic `PingContext` probes and remove replicas from balancing only after the configured failure threshold.
- Set `Config.HealthCheckContext` when health checks should inherit a
  caller-owned shutdown context; otherwise they use `context.Background()` and
  stop through `Cluster.Close`.
- `ReplicaWeights`, when provided, must match the replica count and each weight
  must be positive. Use `NewWeightedBalancerE` for constructor-time validation
  when creating a weighted balancer directly. An empty direct weighted balancer
  keeps state and behaves like round-robin.
- `Cluster.Close` and health checker stop are idempotent; closing the cluster
  owns and closes the configured `*sql.DB` handles once.

**Quick start:**

```go
cluster, err := rw.New(rw.Config{
    Primary:           primaryDB,
    Replicas:          []*sql.DB{replica1, replica2},
    FallbackToPrimary: true,
    HealthCheck:       rw.DefaultHealthCheckConfig(),
})
```

Use `FallbackToPrimary: true` only when serving stale-sensitive reads from the primary during replica outages is acceptable for your service. If you need read-after-write visibility on a per-request basis, wrap the read context with `rw.WithForcePrimary(ctx)` instead of changing the whole cluster policy.

**See:** `x/data/rw/module.yaml` for full manifest.

### x/data/sharding — Sharding Router

**Purpose:** Routes SQL queries to the correct shard in a horizontally-partitioned database cluster. Each shard is an `rw.Cluster`, so read-write splitting and replica health management are inherited automatically.

**When to use:**
- Data is horizontally partitioned across multiple database instances.
- You need deterministic, key-based routing before queries reach the database.
- You want pluggable sharding strategies (hash, mod, range, list, or custom).

**Key types:**

| Type / Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `Router` | Routes `ExecContext`, `QueryContext`, `QueryRowContext`, `BeginTxOnShard` across shards |
| `NewRouter(shards, registry, opts...)` | Constructor; returns `(*Router, error)` |
| `ClusterDB` | Convenience wrapper that builds rw clusters from sharding config and delegates routing to `Router` |
| `New(ClusterConfig)` | Convenience constructor for `ClusterDB`; takes ownership of configured shard DB handles |
| `RouterConfig` | `CrossShardPolicy`, `DefaultShardIndex`, `EnableMetrics` |
| `WithCrossShardPolicy(p)` | Option: `CrossShardDeny` (default), `CrossShardFirst`, `CrossShardAll` |
| `Strategy` | Interface for sharding strategies |
| `ShardingRuleRegistry` | Holds per-table sharding rules and strategies |
| `ShardKeyResolver` | Extracts shard key from SQL query arguments |
| `SQLRewriter` | Rewrites logical table names to physical shard-suffixed names |

**Cross-shard policies:**

| Policy | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `CrossShardDeny` | Reject queries that cannot be resolved to a single shard (safe default) |
| `CrossShardFirst` | Execute `QueryContext` on the first resolved shard, or shard 0 for unresolved multi-row queries; `QueryRowContext` requires an explicit default shard for unresolved queries |
| `CrossShardAll` | Fan-out to all shards concurrently, return the first successful result, and cancel remaining shard queries; it does not merge rows across shards |

**Sharding strategies** (all implement `Strategy`):

| Strategy | Constructor | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Hash | `NewHashStrategy()` | FNV hash of the key, modulo shard count |
| Mod | `NewModStrategy()` | Integer key modulo shard count |
| Range | `NewRangeStrategy(defs)` | Key falls within a defined numeric range |
| List | `NewListStrategy(mapping)` | Key matches a discrete value list |

**Strategy selection guidance:**

- `mod` for stable integer IDs and evenly distributed numeric keys.
- `hash` for arbitrary strings or other non-numeric keys.
- `range` for ordered domains where operators need predictable shard spans.
- `list` for a small, explicit set of values such as region codes.

**Routing limits and transactions:**

- Keep `CrossShardDeny` unless a specific read path can tolerate approximate or first-success semantics.
- `DefaultShardConfig` keeps `FallbackToPrimary` disabled; set it explicitly
  when primary-backed outage reads are acceptable.
- `CrossShardAll` returns the first successful `*sql.Rows`; callers must not
  expect merged result sets, and late successful rows are closed by the router.
- `IN` and bounded range predicates can resolve to multiple shards; they still follow the configured cross-shard policy.
- `QueryRowContext` returns routing errors from `Scan`. Unresolved single-row
  queries require an explicit `DefaultShardIndex`; argument resolution errors
  and invalid shard indexes still fail closed.
- SQL rewriting supports simple single-statement table replacement. Nested
  `SELECT`, CTE, `UNION`, and multiple-statement queries fail closed instead of
  using broad string replacement.
- SQL rewriting only changes table identifiers in SQL code regions. String
  literals and comments are preserved, and schema-qualified target tables such
  as `public.users` fail closed until parser-backed schema support is added.
- SQL routing support is intentionally narrow while this package uses a
  standard-library parser: single-statement, single-table
  SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE only. Joins, subqueries, unions, RETURNING/HAVING,
  top-level OR predicates, schema-qualified routing targets, and INSERT values
  that cannot be mapped one-to-one to placeholders fail closed.
- Use `BeginTxOnShard(ctx, shardIndex, opts)` when the target shard is known. `BeginTx` without a configured `DefaultShardIndex` returns an error.
- Keep `DefaultShardIndex` at `-1` by default so unresolved routing stays visible instead of silently pinning traffic to one shard.
- `ShardingRuleRegistry` protects its map under concurrent access. Returned
  `*ShardingRule` values should still be treated as immutable once a router is
  built.

**Observability boundary:**

- `x/data/sharding` may expose local topology metrics and lightweight trace
  helpers for shard decisions, SQL classification, and rewrite/cache counters.
- Sharding logging and trace attributes must not record raw SQL text, query
  arguments, or shard-key values by default. Record safe metadata such as
  operation, shard index, table name, argument count, and redaction markers
  instead.
- Error strings are redacted in sharding logs and local trace events by default
  because driver errors can contain SQL, DSNs, credentials, or tokens; use
  error type and redaction markers for operational correlation.
- Generic tracing infrastructure, exporters, collectors, and sampling policy
  belong in `x/observability`; do not import `x/observability` into `x/data`
  just to wire a backend.
- Prometheus text emitted by the sharding metrics helper is local topology
  output. Broader export orchestration belongs in `x/observability`. The helper
  exposes latency min/avg/max and histogram buckets, but not percentiles.
- Router `SingleShardQueries` counts queries planned for exactly one shard.
  Cross-shard fan-out updates `CrossShardQueries` and per-shard execution
  counts without inflating the single-shard total.

**Quick start:**

```go
// Build one rw.Cluster per shard
shards := []*rw.Cluster{shard0, shard1, shard2, shard3}

// Register sharding rules
registry := sharding.NewShardingRuleRegistry()
rule, err := sharding.NewShardingRule("orders", "user_id", sharding.NewHashStrategy(), len(shards))
if err != nil {
    return err
}
if err := registry.Register(rule); err != nil {
    return err
}

// Create router
router, err := sharding.NewRouter(shards, registry,
    sharding.WithCrossShardPolicy(sharding.CrossShardDeny),
)
```

**Dynamic config:** Live rule updates are available via `x/data/sharding/config` — see `x/data/sharding/config/README.md`. `ConfigWatcher.Start` is a single-use lifecycle method; repeated starts return an error, while `Stop` is idempotent. Environment overrides are validated before a reloaded config is published; invalid overrides fail closed and keep the previous config. Generated DSNs escape values that need URL encoding or PostgreSQL quoting instead of using raw concatenation.

**See:** `x/data/sharding/module.yaml` for full manifest.

## Composition pattern

`x/data/rw` and `x/data/sharding` are designed to compose:

```
Application
    └── sharding.Router          (horizontal partitioning)
            └── rw.Cluster × N   (primary/replica per shard)
                    └── *sql.DB  (physical connections)
```

Build each shard as an `rw.Cluster`, then pass the slice to `sharding.NewRouter`.
