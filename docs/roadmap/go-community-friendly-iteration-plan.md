# Plumego: Go Community-Friendly Iteration Plan

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** June 2026  
**Audience:** Maintainers, contributors, and code agents  
**Goal:** Position Plumego as the standard-library-first toolkit for Go developers who value explicit, maintainable, agent-friendly services.

---

## Executive Summary

Plumego is a well-architected HTTP toolkit that deserves recognition in the Go community, but its narrative is unclear and its adoption barriers are higher than they need to be. The project has:

- ✅ Zero external dependencies in the stable core
- ✅ Explicit wiring and transparent boundaries (`specs/`, `reference/`, `module.yaml`)
- ✅ Nine stable root packages with full v1 compatibility
- ✅ Seven beta extensions covering major use cases
- ✅ Agent-friendly control plane (tasks, specs, checks)

But it faces:

- ❌ **Positioning unclear:** Readers confuse Plumego with Gin/Echo/Fiber clones instead of understanding it as a stdlib-first toolkit
- ❌ **High first-impression friction:** "Quick Start" jumps to `plumego.New()` before explaining the design philosophy
- ❌ **Adoption path under-documented:** Getting from "hello world" to "production" lacks intermediate checkpoints
- ❌ **Missing v1 readiness artifacts:** No STABILITY.md, COMPATIBILITY.md, or migration matrix
- ❌ **Extension ecosystem unclear:** 15 `x/*` packages with mixed maturity, but no clear "which should I use?" guide
- ❌ **Examples lag:** `reference/` is good but incomplete for common patterns
- ❌ **Documentation too distributed:** Important constraints scattered across AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, specs/, docs/operations/, and docs/concepts/

**This plan proposes 20 small, mergeable PRs that clarify positioning, improve first-contact experience, solidify v1 readiness, and make the repository more agent-friendly.**

## Current Value Assessment

### What Plumego solves

1. **For Go developers tired of "frameworks":** Plumego keeps you in control. Handlers are plain `http.Handler`. Middleware wraps `http.Handler`. Wiring is explicit in your `main` package. No magic registration, no context service-locators, no reflection-based DI.

2. **For teams building maintainable services:** The stable core (9 packages, ~2K LOC each) is small enough to understand completely. `reference/standard-service` shows the only correct wiring pattern. `specs/dependency-rules.yaml` prevents accidental coupling.

3. **For projects using code agents:** Plumego's control plane (`specs/`, `tasks/`, `reference/`, `module.yaml`, `internal/checks/`) makes scope, boundaries, and validation discoverable. Agents can read the repository and understand what's safe to change without human context.

4. **For services that need to grow:** Start with just `core`, `router`, `contract`. Add `middleware`, `security`, `store`, `health`, `log`, `metrics` only as responsibilities emerge. Optional `x/*` families layer on capabilities without pulling in the stable surface.

### Why it should exist alongside stdlib, Gin, Echo, Fiber, Chi

| Framework | Position | Tradeoff |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| `http.ServeMux` | Minimal routing | Zero framework learning; high wiring boilerplate |
| **Plumego** | **Thin layer on stdlib** | **Small API surface; explicit wiring; stdlib compatibility** |
| Chi | Lightweight router | Pleasant router API; middleware composition pattern diverges from stdlib |
| Gin | Fast + convenient | Excellent devX; hides implicit binding, response wrapping, panics-as-errors |
| Echo | Feature-rich | Broader conventions; less transparent; steeper onboarding for small services |
| Fiber | High performance | Fasthttp (non-stdlib); significant framework coupling |

Plumego is **not** trying to be the fastest or the most convenient. It's the **explicitly maintained** choice for developers who want:
- Zero surprises (explicit > implicit)
- Testability without test helpers
- Minimal dependencies (focus on your service, not framework internals)
- Code that reads the same way for 3 years as it did day 1
- Repositories that agents can safely maintain

### What risks confuse new users

1. **"Is this a Gin clone?"** — No, but we haven't explained why we're NOT one.
2. **"When do I use `plumego.New()` vs. `core.New()`?"** — This is a real API design question that is documented but not highlighted.
3. **"Is `x/ai` production-ready?"** — Unclear; needs explicit "stable surface" marking within experimental families.
4. **"Can I mix Plumego with other middleware?"** — Yes, but that needs a dedicated migration guide.
5. **"What's the difference between `reference/standard-service` and `reference/with-rest`?"** — Both are canonical; unclear when to copy which.
6. **"Am I supposed to read AGENTS.md?"** — It's primarily for maintainers; external readers get lost in agent context.

### What must be clarified before v1 is truly "done"

1. A STABILITY.md file that clearly states what is and is not stable
2. Migration guides for coming FROM other frameworks and for future breaking changes
3. Boundary documentation for each module (what goes in, what doesn't)
4. Clear "agent-safe" vs. "maintainer-only" docs
5. A public-API inventory (what's exported, what's internal, what's beta)
6. A v1 release readiness checklist

## Positioning Recommendation

### Core positioning

**"Plumego is the standard-library-first HTTP toolkit for Go developers building explicit, maintainable, agent-friendly services."**

Expand to:

> Plumego combines the familiar shapes of `net/http` with just enough structure to build production services without a framework. Handlers are plain `func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request)`. Middleware wraps `http.Handler`. Wiring is visible in your `main` package. The stable core has zero external dependencies. Optional `x/*` families add capabilities without baking them into the learning path.
>
> Choose Plumego if you:
> - Want to understand every line of your HTTP server's wiring
> - Prefer stdlib shapes and patterns
> - Expect your service to live for years with predictable maintenance
> - Use code agents to assist development
> - Value small, testable, refactorable code over convenience

### Messaging hierarchy

**Level 1 — Why Plumego exists:**
- Standard library first (all stable roots use only stdlib)
- Explicit wiring (no hidden binding, no context service-locators)
- Small stable surface (9 packages, flat learning curve)
- Agent-friendly (control plane in `specs/`, `reference/`, `module.yaml`)
- Optional capabilities (extensions layer on, don't bloat core)

**Level 2 — What you can build:**
- Plain JSON APIs (start with `reference/standard-service`)
- REST with CRUD conventions (`x/rest`)
- Multi-tenant services (`x/tenant`)
- Real-time WebSocket (`x/websocket`)
- Edge/gateway (`x/gateway`)
- Observability (`x/observability`)
- Messaging/webhooks (`x/messaging`)

**Level 3 — Who this is for:**
- Go developers tired of framework magic
- Teams building long-lived services
- Projects using AI/code agents
- Organizations standardizing on stdlib patterns

### Where NOT to position Plumego

- ❌ **Not a "Gin/Echo replacement."** (Position as complementary to stdlib, not competitive with frameworks.)
- ❌ **Not the fastest.** (We're not chasing Fiber's fasthttp performance.)
- ❌ **Not a "batteries-included" framework.** (We're stdlib-first by design.)
- ❌ **Not for teams who want zero wiring code.** (We're explicit, not magic.)

## Stable Core Proposal

### Current state (v1.1.0)

**9 stable roots (GA, full v1 compatibility):**
- `core` — App construction, lifecycle, routes, middleware attachment
- `router` — Route matching, params, groups, reverse URL generation
- `contract` — Response writers, error builders, transport binding
- `middleware` — Transport-layer middleware composition + standard packages
- `security` — Auth, JWT, password, headers, abuse guards
- `store` — Storage contracts + in-memory primitives (cache, KV, file, DB, idempotency)
- `health` — Health/readiness status models
- `log` — Minimal logging interfaces + default logger
- `metrics` — Minimal metrics contracts

**7 beta extensions (API stable across cited release refs):**
- `x/rest`, `x/websocket`, `x/gateway`, `x/observability`, `x/tenant`, `x/frontend`, `x/messaging` (app-facing)

**Remaining 8 `x/*` are experimental** (APIs may change in any minor version):
- `x/ai` (mostly; `x/ai/provider`, `x/ai/session`, `x/ai/streaming`, `x/ai/tool` have beta evidence)
- `x/data` (mostly; `x/data/file`, `x/data/idempotency` have beta evidence)
- `x/fileapi`, `x/openapi`, `x/resilience`, `x/rpc`, `x/validate`, `x/gateway/discovery`, `x/gateway/ipc`, `x/observability/devtools`, `x/observability/ops`

### Proposal: No changes to stable surface

The nine stable roots are well-designed and need no API changes. The beta extensions are also appropriately scoped. This plan proposes **zero public API changes**. Instead, we focus on:

1. **Clarity:** Documenting what's stable, beta, and experimental
2. **Examples:** Completing `reference/` scenarios
3. **Adoption:** Improving the path from 5 minutes to 1 day
4. **Boundaries:** Making module responsibilities explicit
5. **Artifacts:** Adding v1 readiness documents

### Module boundaries (to clarify, not change)

| Module | Owns | Does NOT own |
|--------|------|--------------|
| `core` | App, routes, middleware attachment, lifecycle | Response formatting, middleware implementations, storage, business logic |
| `router` | Route matching, params, groups, metadata | Response building, request binding, service injection |
| `contract` | Success/error responses, request accessors, metadata | Validation logic, business DTO assembly, storage queries |
| `middleware` | Transport-layer concerns (logging, tracing, timeouts, CORS, recovery) | Business logic injection, DTO assembly, domain-policy branching |
| `security` | Auth adapters, JWT, password hashing, abuse guards | User/role/permission stores, business policy enforcement |
| `store` | Storage contracts + in-memory implementations (cache, KV, file, idempotency) | ORM wiring, business repositories, query builders |
| `health` | Health check models and status propagation | Business-logic health determination, actual probes |
| `log` | Logging interfaces + default logger | Application business logging (callers own that) |
| `metrics` | Metrics contracts and collectors | Metric definition (callers own what to measure) |

## Adoption Path Audit

### Current state

README.md, docs/start/, and reference/ exist, but the path is rough:

1. **5 minutes:** README quick-start works. But positioning is mixed up with API details.
2. **30 minutes:** docs/start/adoption-path.md and reference/standard-service README exist but are scattered. No clear "next 25 minutes" roadmap.
3. **1 day:** docs/start/adoption-path.md section §3 exists, but it points to 80 files, not a clear sequence.

### Major gaps

1. **No "Why Plumego?"** page. Developers land on README and don't understand the positioning until halfway through.
2. **No "Quick reference" card.** Many services just need: routing, request context, structured responses. Should be 1 page.
3. **Migration guides incomplete.** from-gin.md, from-echo.md, from-chi.md exist but are sparse. from-stdmux is missing.
4. **No "when to use `x/*`" decision tree.** Choosing between 15 extensions is daunting.
5. **No "architecture checklist."** What should a production Plumego service have? (config, logging, metrics, structured errors, request ID, graceful shutdown)
6. **Examples missing:**
   - `examples/hello` — minimal 5-minute runnable
   - `examples/standard-api` — 30-minute CRUD JSON API
   - `examples/with-tenant` — multi-tenant example (separate from reference/)
   - `examples/with-middleware-compat` — mixing Plumego with third-party middleware

### Proposed adoption flow (2-hour onboarding)

1. **0-3 min:** Skim README "Positioning" section (NEW)
2. **3-5 min:** Run examples/hello, see it work
3. **5-15 min:** Copy reference/standard-service, add one GET endpoint
4. **15-30 min:** Add config, logging, graceful shutdown (via reference/standard-service deep dive)
5. **30-60 min:** Choose one capability (REST, tenant, observability) and add it
6. **60-120 min:** Read AGENTS.md and understand the control plane

## Major Gaps

### Documentation gaps

| Gap | Severity | Impact | Proposed fix |
|-----|----------|--------|--------------|
| No STABILITY.md or COMPATIBILITY.md | HIGH | Users can't tell what's safe to depend on | New files clarifying v1 guarantee |
| "Why Plumego?" narrative missing | HIGH | Developers don't understand positioning | Restructure README; add POSITIONING.md |
| No clear "stable vs. beta vs. experimental" marking in main docs | HIGH | Extension choices are confusing | Add extension decision tree + maturity checklist |

### Example gaps

| Missing | Why it matters | Proposed |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| `examples/hello` | Developers want copy-paste quick start | 10 lines, runnable in < 1 min |
| `examples/standard-api` | 30-min path to CRUD API | Expand reference/standard-service as standalone example |
| `examples/error-handling` | Common task; currently scattered in docs | Focused example of contract.WriteError, recovery, logging |
| `examples/middleware-third-party` | Many have existing middleware stacks | Show how to use Chi/gorilla/other middleware with Plumego |
| `examples/tenant-auth` | Multi-tenant + auth is a common ask | Combine x/tenant + security middleware |
| `examples/observability-stack` | Prometheus/OTel integration is needed | Minimal example of x/observability wiring |

### Code gaps

| Gap | Severity | Impact | Fix |
|-----|----------|--------|-----|
| Some x/* packages lack module.yaml | MEDIUM | Agents can't query owner, risk, validation | Add to all x/* roots |
| Deprecation inventory incomplete | LOW | Future removals will be unclear | Review specs/deprecation-inventory.yaml; document all deprecated symbols |
| No public API snapshot/inventory | MEDIUM | Version sync is manual | Auto-generate list of exported symbols per module |
| Missing tests for edge cases in x/* | LOW | Experimental packages may have quality gaps | Audit coverage, mark test blockers in module.yaml |

## Iteration Strategy

### Principles

1. **No public API changes.** Stable roots stay stable. Extensions stay at current status.
2. **Small, mergeable PRs.** Each task is ~1 file or ~50 lines. No multi-file refactors.
3. **Focus on clarity and adoption.** Documentation, examples, and artifacts over features.
4. **Verify before shipping.** Every change has a verification step (see matrix below).
5. **Agent-friendly first.** Changes preserve and extend the control plane, not replace it.

### Release cadence for this iteration

- **Phase 1 (Docs + Examples):** Tasks 1-8 (this month) — positioning, adoption path, examples
- **Phase 2 (Artifacts + Boundaries):** Tasks 9-15 (next month) — STABILITY.md, module docs, extension checklist
- **Phase 3 (Polish + Verification):** Tasks 16-20 (end of next month) — roadmap, release notes, v1 readiness checklist

Each phase is released as a PR so progress is visible.

## Verification Matrix

### Tests to run for each PR

| PR # | Files | Command | Pass Criteria |
|------|-------|---------|---------------|
| 1-4 | *.md (docs) | `make verify-links` (check links) | All links resolve |
| 5-7 | examples/ | `make verify-examples` (compile + basic tests) | `go test ./...` passes |
| 8-15 | docs/ | `make verify-links` + manual review | No 404s; content makes sense |
| 16 | docs/start/ | Get 2-3 volunteers to follow path; time it | Takes roughly stated time |
| 17 | README_CN.md | Manual review of translation | Reads naturally in Chinese |
| 18 | docs/operations/ | Manual review | Explains control plane clearly |
| 19 | READINESS.md | Manual verification | Checklist is complete and accurate |
| 20 | docs/release/ | Manual review | Release notes are compelling |

### Full validation before release

```bash
# Code gates (all examples compile, tests pass, no vet errors)
make gates

# Check all links in markdown (new tool or manual spot-check)
grep -r "http" docs/ README.md | grep -v "github.com/spcent/plumego" | head -20

# Verify examples run
go run ./examples/hello/main.go &
sleep 1 && curl http://localhost:8080/ping
killall main

# Verify docs are in sync with code
go run ./internal/checks/module-manifests
go run ./internal/checks/dependency-rules
go run ./internal/checks/public-entrypoints-sync

# Spot-check deprecation inventory is accurate
go run ./internal/checks/deprecation-inventory -strict
```

## Claude/Codex Usage Notes

### How to use this plan with code agents

**For agents maintaining Plumego:**

1. Read this document before any PR
2. Follow the PR queue in order (Phase 1 → 2 → 3)
3. Each PR is 1 task: don't combine them
4. Before editing: read the Context file(s) listed in the task
5. After editing: verify with the command in the Verification Matrix
6. When done: open a PR with summary of what changed, verified by which commands
7. If you get stuck: check `specs/stop-condition-handlers.yaml` for guidance

**For external agents using Plumego:**

1. Read POSITIONING.md to understand the project
2. Read STABILITY.md to know what's safe to depend on
3. Read docs/modules/INDEX.md to understand ownership
4. For any change: check specs/task-routing.yaml to find the owning module
5. Read the owning module's module.yaml for validation commands
6. Read the owning module's README for the design
7. If boundaries are unclear: check specs/dependency-rules.yaml
8. Run `make validate-diff` to check your change before submitting

## Final v1 Readiness Checklist

Before calling v1 "final," verify:

### Positioning ✅
- [ ] README starts with "Why Plumego?" and comparison table
- [ ] POSITIONING.md exists and is linked from README
- [ ] Comparison with stdlib, Chi, Gin, Echo, Fiber is clear and accurate
- [ ] "Not for teams who want zero wiring code" is explicitly stated

### Stability ✅
- [ ] STABILITY.md lists all 9 stable roots with v1 guarantee
- [ ] STABILITY.md lists all 7 beta extensions with release refs
- [ ] STABILITY.md lists all experimental packages
- [ ] COMPATIBILITY.md explains upgrade paths
- [ ] No dangling package names (all listed packages exist)
- [ ] `docs/reference/extension-stability-policy.md` is referenced from both

### Adoption Path ✅
- [ ] examples/hello runs in 1 minute
- [ ] examples/standard-api is runnable and annotated
- [ ] docs/start/adoption-path.md flows linearly (5 min → 30 min → 1 day)
- [ ] All links in adoption-path point to existing files
- [ ] volunteers can follow path without asking questions

### Boundaries ✅
- [ ] docs/modules/INDEX.md maps all 9 stable roots
- [ ] Each module's README has "owns" and "doesn't own" sections
- [ ] module.yaml is present in core/, router/, contract/, middleware/, security/, store/, health/, log/, metrics/
- [ ] module.yaml is present in all x/* roots (even experimental)
- [ ] module.yaml fields are consistent and accurate

### Control Plane ✅
- [ ] specs/task-routing.yaml is accurate
- [ ] specs/dependency-rules.yaml prevents stable→x/* imports
- [ ] internal/checks/ passes all baseline checks
- [ ] AGENTS.md is move-friendly (can be relocated without breaking understanding)
- [ ] docs/operations/agent-external-reference.md guides external agents

### Verification ✅
- [ ] `make gates` passes (all tests, vet, coverage)
- [ ] `make validate-diff` passes (quicker validation)
- [ ] All examples compile
- [ ] All links in docs/ resolve
- [ ] Release notes are ready

### Release ✅
- [ ] Version tag is prepared (v1.x.x)
- [ ] docs/release/V1-RELEASE-NOTES.md is finalized
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md is updated
- [ ] GitHub release is drafted
- [ ] Announcement is queued for blog/Twitter/community

## Commands to Run for Verification

After all PRs are merged:

```bash
# Full validation suite
make gates

# Minimal diff validation (recommended before opening PR)
make validate-diff

# Check all links in docs (manual or add to Makefile)
grep -r "http" docs/ README.md | grep -v "github.com/spcent/plumego" | wc -l

# Verify examples compile
go test ./examples/...

# Verify manifests are complete and consistent
go run ./internal/checks/module-manifests
go run ./internal/checks/extension-maturity
go run ./internal/checks/deprecation-inventory -strict

# Verify boundaries
go run ./internal/checks/dependency-rules
go run ./internal/checks/reference-layout

# Spot-check key API surfaces (godoc)
go doc -short github.com/spcent/plumego/core | head -30
go doc -short github.com/spcent/plumego/router | head -30
go doc -short github.com/spcent/plumego/contract | head -30
```

## Conclusion

Plumego is a well-architected, production-ready toolkit. This plan clarifies positioning, improves adoption, and solidifies v1 readiness without any public API changes or risky refactors. Over 20 focused PRs, we will:

1. **Explain why Plumego exists** (not try to be Gin/Echo)
2. **Make it easier to start** (examples, adoption path, migration guides)
3. **Clarify what's safe to depend on** (STABILITY.md, COMPATIBILITY.md)
4. **Help extensions grow safely** (decision trees, maturity markers, extension guide)
5. **Support agents as first-class maintainers** (control plane documentation, clear boundaries)

The result is a project that is **friendly to Go developers**, **safe for code agents**, and **ready for widespread adoption** in the community.
