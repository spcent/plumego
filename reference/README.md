# reference/

This directory contains Plumego reference applications. Each app is a
self-contained Go module that demonstrates a specific capability or deployment
pattern. They are teaching tools, not production bundles — every middleware and
route decision is visible and intentional.

For production-scale applications with external dependencies (MongoDB,
Kubernetes, Prometheus), see [`use-cases/`](../use-cases/AGENTS.md).

## Canonical references

### standard-service

The canonical Plumego application shape. Read this before any other reference
app. It teaches explicit middleware wiring, standard-library HTTP handlers, the
`run()`/`app.Start(ctx)` bootstrap pattern, and stable-root-only dependencies.

- No `x/*` imports.
- Every middleware is named and ordered explicitly in `internal/app/app.go`.
- Every route is named and registered explicitly in `internal/app/routes.go`.
- Has `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENT_TASKS.md`, `PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

### production-service

Extends `standard-service` with production-grade security and observability:
bearer-token auth (fail-closed), abuse guard, tracing, HTTP metrics, access
logs, tenant context, and an explicit ops route. Shows the secure, hardened
baseline before adding `x/*` capabilities.

- All middleware from `standard-service` plus tracing, httpmetrics, and
  rate-limit abuse guard.
- Protected `GET /api/profile` (bearer + tenant) and `GET /ops/metrics` (bearer).
- Has `AGENT_TASKS.md`, `PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md`.

## Feature scenario references

Each `with-*` app starts from `standard-service` and adds exactly one
capability. They are non-canonical: they import `x/*` and exist to show
integration patterns, not to be used as a baseline.

### with-ai

Shows the stable-tier `x/ai` subpackages: `provider`, `session`, `streaming`,
and `tool`. Safe first path for adding an LLM backend with streaming responses,
conversation history, and function calling.

### with-events

Wires an HTTP app to asynchronous order events with in-process pub/sub
(`x/messaging/pubsub`), idempotent consumption, delayed retry, and optional
outbound webhook delivery.

### with-frontend

Serves a static frontend (embedded assets) alongside an API, using `x/frontend`
for asset embedding and cache-control.

### with-gateway

Adds `x/gateway` reverse proxy to route incoming requests to a backend service.
Shows proxy construction, backend configuration, and wildcard route mounting.

### with-messaging

Adds `x/messaging` in-process pub/sub broker: publish domain events from
handlers, subscribe from background workers, and fan out to multiple consumers.

### with-ops

Mounts protected `x/observability/ops` routes and stable request-observability
middleware. Shows the pattern for internal metrics and health aggregation without
exposing debug tooling in production.

### with-rest

Adds `x/rest` resource controllers to a service that still follows the
`standard-service` layout. Shows controller registration, resource routing, and
response standardization.

### with-rpc

Hosts a gRPC service with `x/rpc/server` and exposes it over HTTP through
`x/rpc/gateway`. One-shot demo: runs a single test request and exits; does not
use the long-running `run()` signal pattern.

### with-tenant

Adds `x/tenant` resolution, policy, quota, and rate limiting. Shows how to
extract tenant ID from headers, enforce per-tenant policies, and surface quota
errors.

### with-tenant-admin

Self-contained multi-tenant administrative plane. Demonstrates tenant lifecycle
operations, quota administration, usage recording, and fail-closed admin
authentication using `x/tenant` primitives.

### with-webhook

Adds `x/messaging/webhook` inbound webhook receivers for GitHub and Stripe.
Shows HMAC signature verification, event routing, and idempotent handler
dispatch.

### with-websocket

Adds `x/websocket` WebSocket server with hub, room broadcast, and client
lifecycle management. Shows hub construction, connection upgrade, and graceful
shutdown.

## Tooling

### benchmark

A separate Go module (`reference/benchmark`) for local HTTP throughput
benchmarks comparing Plumego against chi, gin, and echo. Keeps
comparison-only dependencies out of the main module.
